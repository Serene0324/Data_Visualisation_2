        <h1>Population and Student Enrolments of Malaysia (2022)</h1>
        <p>This visualisation explores how Malaysia’s population is distributed across states and how student enrolment patterns compare to population size.
            Together, these charts reveal where education demand is concentrated and highlight demographic or infrastructural differences among states.</p>

          <h2>Population by State</h2>
          <p>States like <strong>Selangor</strong>, <strong>Johor</strong>, and <strong>Sabah</strong> dominate the population distribution, 
            reflecting their larger urban areas and economic hubs.
            Meanwhile, smaller federal territories like Labuan and Putrajaya occupy a very small proportion of the total population.<br>
            This map provides geographic context for later charts — showing where most people live before comparing how many are actually enrolled in schools. </p>

          <h2>Total Population vs <br> Student Enrolments by State</h2>
          <p>Most states follow a balanced pattern, but <strong>Labuan</strong> and <strong>Putrajaya</strong> stand out as outliers 
            — both have more student enrolments than residents.<br>
            <br>
            This could indicate that many students from other states travel to study in Labuan and Putrajaya, 
            where government schools and administrative facilities are highly concentrated.
            Their relatively small populations make even moderate enrolment numbers appear disproportionately large. </p>

          <h2>Student Enrolments by Education Stages and States</h2>
          <p>This stacked bar chart shows how student enrolments are distributed across <strong>primary</strong>, <strong>secondary</strong>, 
            and <strong>post-secondary</strong> levels in each state.<br><br>
            Most states have the largest share in primary education, followed by secondary, and a much smaller share in post-secondary.<br><br>
            The higher number of primary students reflects Malaysia’s compulsory primary education (6 years) and broader age base at that level.<br><br>
            Fewer students in secondary and post-secondary levels may be due to dropouts, vocational training alternatives, or migration 
            for higher education. </p>

          <h2>Gender Distribution of Student Enrolments</h2>
          <p>These diverging bars show the proportion of <strong>male (left)</strong> and <strong>female (right)</strong> students across 
            all states, separated by education level (primary, secondary, post-secondary).<br><br>
            The gender distribution appears fairly balanced across most states, with minor female dominance in secondary and post-secondary levels.<br><br>
            This balance reflects Malaysia’s commitment to equal education access for both genders.<br><br>
            Slightly higher female participation in higher levels may suggest improving retention and performance rates among female students, 
            a trend consistent with national education reports.</p>

              Together, these charts show how population, enrolment, and gender balance interact across Malaysia’s states —
              offering insights into demographic education patterns and regional disparities.
